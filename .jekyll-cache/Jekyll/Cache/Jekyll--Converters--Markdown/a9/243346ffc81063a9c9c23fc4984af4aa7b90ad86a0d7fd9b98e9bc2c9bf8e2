<h2 id="hello">Hello</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m Blake, and Iâ€™m learning how to be a technologist. Well, a new, specific version of a technologist anyway. Iâ€™ve 
always been a technologist. My early tech experiences include erector sets, electronics tinkering and general 
analyses of systems. Later I got into computer building and repair, digital media production and tabular data models. 
Now Iâ€™m tackling computer programming.</p>

<p>I love the web and itâ€™s ability to empower people by providing access to valuable information. With this in mind, I am 
focusing my studies on fullstack web development. Iâ€™m working a lot with javascript, because of itâ€™s necessity for front 
end scripting, as well as itâ€™s lightweight backend proficiency. I like to add es-next abilities to my toolkit as often 
as possible. Using javascript as a strongly-typed and class-based language, ie typescript / angular, is pretty neat, 
and because I donâ€™t have a classical OOP background I donâ€™t even notice any hacky bits. Iâ€™m learning that growing a 
high stack overflow score is seriously one of the coolest (and certainly hardest) things you can do as a programmer.</p>

<h2 id="this-site">This site</h2>
<p>This site is built with Jekyll and hosted via GitHub pages. Source files are available <a href="https://github.com/Blake-Jarsky/blake-jarsky.github.io" target="_blank">here.</a> It is a work in 
progress. Iâ€™m planning on adding some bootstrap elements, expanding the list of links that have been helpful in my 
learning, integrating a standard contact form (github pages being static has me looking at POST-less API-based 
solutions), and some design components/techniques (like gradient borders and CSS animations). Additional near-term 
plans include switching the nav bar to a flexbox and going through it using more semantic html, to start getting it 
to a more a11y state.</p>
